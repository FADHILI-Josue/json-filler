**Json Filler** is a Chrome extension designed to boost developer productivity by automatically filling JSON inputs (like in Swagger UI) with realistic, context-aware dummy data.

It recursively parses your JSON schema and generates smart data based on keys (e.g., email, phone) and preserves the format of existing numbers.

## ✨ Features

- **Context-Aware**: Detects keys like `email`, `phone`, `uuid`, and `date` to generate relevant data.
- **Smart Numbers**: Preserves the length and decimal precision of example numbers.
- **Deep Parsing**: Works with deeply nested objects and complex arrays.
- **Privacy Focused**: All generation happens locally in the browser.
